# WebSockets-Socket.io-
Using Socket.io and Socket.io-client npm packages, we establish a connection to send files between the server and client. We split files to small chunks and send one file at a time recursively


Add a /saved and a /processed folder. 
To run the above code, 
> npm install
> npm start

You need to have nodemon installed. 

The Client Code is in https://github.com/abishekg/WebSockets-Socket.io-Client-.git
